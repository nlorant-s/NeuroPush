# NeuroPush
*A PushGP Neuroevolution Framework*

## Motivation

### What is NeuroPush?

NeuroPush is a neuroevolution framework that utilizes Push Genetic Programming (PushGP) to discover optimal neural network architectures. With NeuroPush, neural networks are represented by Push integer and float stacks, offering a versatile and extensive search space.

### Why NeuroPush?

The Push Language provides state-of-the-art genetic programming capabilities. It utilizes stochastic (typically evolutionary) search methods to intelligently search the space of programs. The fundamental output is a program written in the Turing complete Push language, which is then initialized and evaluated as a neural network. Utilizing Push, one of the most powerful "general program synthesis" frameworks, may prove to be advantageous for neuroevolution.

### Goals of NeuroPush

NeuroPush aims to optimize neural networks in complex search spaces, with a specific interest in metacognition and general intelligence. Development of NeuroPush is still in progress. Research on NeuroPush may be conducted in the future.

## PyshGP

Neuropush utilizes PyshGP, a Python package for PushGP. Documentation for the `pyshgp` API  can be found [here](http://erp12.github.io/pyshgp). More information about PushGP can be found on the [Push Redux](https://erp12.github.io/push-redux/) the [Push Homepage](http://faculty.hampshire.edu/lspector/push.html) and the [Push Language Discourse](https://Push-language.hampshire.edu).
