# NeuroPush

*Neuroevolution with Push Genetic Programming*

## Motivation

### What is NeuroPush?

NeuroPush is a neuroevolution method that utilizes the Push Language to evolve neural network architectures and parameters. Neural networks are mapped to Push int and float stacks, providing versatile and extensive search space optimization.

### Why NeuroPush?

The Push Language offers state-of-the-art genetic programming capabilities. It utilizes stochastic (typically evolutionary) search methods to intelligently search the space of programs. The fundamental output is a program written in the Turing complete Push language. Utilizing Push, one of the most powerful "general program synthesis" frameworks, may prove to be advantageous for neuroevolution.

### Goals of NeuroPush

NeuroPush aims to optimize neural networks in complex search spaces, with a specific interest in metacognition. Development of NeuroPush is still in progress. Research on the advantages of NeuroPush may be conducted in the future.
