# NeuroPush

*Neuroevolution with Push Genetic Programming, in Python!*

## Motivation

### What is NeuroPush?

NeuroPush is a neuroevolution project that utilizes the Push Language to evolve neural network architectures and parameters. Neural networks are mapped to Push int and float stacks, providing a versatile and extensive search space for optimization.

### Why NeuroPush?

The Push Language offers state-of-the-art genetic programming capabilities. It utilizes stochastic (typically evolutionary) search methods to produce programs that are capable of manipulating all the common data types, control structures, and data structures. It is easily extendable to specific use cases and has seen impressive results. PushGP does not optimize a set of numeric parameters using a gradient, but rather attempts to intelligently search the space of programs. The result is a system where the primary output is a program written in the Turing complete Push language. Utilizing one of the most powerful "general program synthesis" frameworks may prove to be advantageous for neuroevolution.

### Goals of NeuroPush

NeuroPush aims to optimize neural networks in complex search spaces. 

Development of NeuroPush is still in progress. Research on the advantages of NeuroPush may be conducted in the future.

## PyshGP Documentation

The full documentation for the `pyshgp` API  can be found [here](http://erp12.github.io/pyshgp).

Example usages of `pyshgp` can be found: 

- In the `examples/` [folder of the pyshgp Github repository](https://github.com/erp12/pyshgp/tree/master/examples).
- In the minimal [pyshgp demo repository](https://github.com/erp12/pyshgp-demo).

More information about PushGP can be found on the [Push Redux](https://erp12.github.io/push-redux/) the [Push Homepage](http://faculty.hampshire.edu/lspector/push.html) and the [Push Language Discourse](https://Push-language.hampshire.edu).
